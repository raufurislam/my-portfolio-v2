Absolutely! Below is a **clean daily Git workflow template/checklist** first, followed by a **README-style note** that you can save in your project or anywhere for future reference.

## ✅ Daily Git Workflow Template (for working after GitHub Pull Request)

```
📌 Daily Git Local Workflow Checklist

1️⃣ Check your current branch
   → git branch

2️⃣ Switch to the branch you want to work on
   → git checkout development
      OR
   → git checkout startup

3️⃣ Pull latest changes from GitHub to keep local in sync
   → git pull origin development
      OR
   → git pull origin startup

4️⃣ Confirm status before editing files
   → git status

5️⃣ Code and save your files

6️⃣ Stage your changes
   → git add .

7️⃣ Commit with a clear message
   → git commit -m "Your commit message here"

8️⃣ Push your changes to GitHub
   → git push origin development
      OR
   → git push origin startup

🆗 Done. Now you can create or merge a pull request via GitHub GUI if needed.

## 📘 README-style: Git Branch Workflow After GitHub Merge

````markdown
# 🚀 Git Branch Workflow After GitHub Pull Request Merge

This guide helps you safely continue development from your local machine after merging a branch on GitHub (using Pull Request).

---

## ✅ Scenario

- You created a branch (e.g., `startup`)
- You pushed and created a Pull Request (PR) via GitHub
- You **merged the PR** into your main branch (e.g., `development`) using GitHub GUI

---

## 🧩 Problem That Might Happen

After merging on GitHub, your local repo may become **out of sync** with GitHub.

- You might work on outdated code
- You might face unnecessary merge conflicts
- You could overwrite new changes accidentally

---

## 🛠️ What You MUST Do Before Coding Again on Local PC

### 1. Pull the Latest Merged Code from GitHub

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Pull latest updates
git pull origin development
```
````

OR if you are continuing on `startup`:

```bash
git checkout startup
git pull origin startup
```

---

## 📅 Daily Git Local Workflow

```bash
# 1. Switch to the correct branch
git checkout development   # or startup

# 2. Pull the latest changes
git pull origin development   # or startup

# 3. Check working directory status
git status

# 4. Work on your code...

# 5. Stage changes
git add .

# 6. Commit changes
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

# 7. Push to GitHub
git push origin development   # or startup
```

---

## 🔁 Creating and Merging Pull Request from GitHub GUI

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin startup
   ```

2. Go to GitHub → Open your repo

3. Click **"Compare & Pull Request"**

4. Ensure:

   - **Base** = `development`
   - **Compare** = `startup`

5. Add title and description, then **Create Pull Request**

6. After code review, click **"Merge Pull Request"** → **Confirm Merge**

7. Optionally, delete the merged branch on GitHub

---

## 🧹 Cleanup After Merge (Local)

If you already merged the branch on GitHub, delete it locally:

```bash
git branch -d startup
```

## ✅ Summary

| Action                | Command                       |

| Pull latest code      | `git pull origin branch-name` |
| Check status          | `git status`                  |
| Add changes           | `git add .`                   |
| Commit                | `git commit -m "msg"`         |
| Push to GitHub        | `git push origin branch-name` |
| Delete branch (local) | `git branch -d branch-name`   |

🧠 **Always pull before starting work to keep your codebase up-to-date!**
